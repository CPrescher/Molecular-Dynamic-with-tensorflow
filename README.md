# Molecular Dynamic (M.D) with tensorflow
This code demonstrate how to build molecular dynamic simulation using tensorflow. 
TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graph,
It mostly used for machine learning but can be used to run any system as that can be written as dataflow graph. The code involve building data flow graph for single simulation step of molecular dynamics.
This basically mean building the molecular dynamic simulation using tensor operations only. This this graph in runned in a loop to create multistep molecular dynamic model. The particles location is plotted on screen in each step.
